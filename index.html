          <h3>
            A Design Sprint provides a simple, timeboxed problem-solving
            framework for product teams to get answers quickly and effectively.
            The exercises embedded in the five phases are designed to reduce
            politics, increase collaboration across functions and put the focus
            on answers (outcomes) and not just assets (outputs). Learn from
            enterprises like Home Depot, LearnVest, IBM, AARP, Fidelity
            Investments, Lidl, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and many more, how you
            can run, facilitate or sponsor your own design sprint and start
            delivering solutions in organizations of any size.
